For a website with busy traffic like coinmarketcap that embeds other websites data and updates them in real-time, any of their underlying javascript could be interferring with the webscraping process. As a result, the data obtained from the website would be limited. However, coinmarket API paid subscriptions(professional and enterprise) could be more efficient in getting more data with ease."
